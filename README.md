## 📱 Main Scenario

![Main Scenario](docs/views/Main_Scenario.png)

## 📊 Calorie Calculation

The app calculates the user's daily caloric needs using the following formulas based on the Harris-Benedict equation:

### For Women
```
calories = 655.1 + (9.56 × weight in kg) + (1.85 × height in cm) - (4.67 × age in years)
```

### For Men
```
calories = 66.47 + (13.75 × weight in kg) + (5 × height in cm) - (6.75 × age in years)
```

### Example Calculation
For a 40-year-old male who is 190cm tall and weighs 90kg:
```
= 66.47 + (13.75 × 90) + (5 × 190) - (6.75 × 40)
= 66.47 + 1,237.5 + 950 - 270
= 1,983.97 calories/day
```

## 🔌 API Integration

### Order Placement

The app makes a POST request to the following endpoint when confirming an order:

```

```

#### Request Payload

    {
      "name": "Beef",
      "total_price": 24,
      "quantity": 2
    }
